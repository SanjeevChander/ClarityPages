# Privacy Policy — Headache Clarity
**Last updated:** October 22, 2025

**Overview.** Headache Clarity stores migraine, sleep, and restless-legs data **on device**. No data leaves the device unless you actively export or share it.

**Data We Collect**
- **Precise Location (while using the app):** Used only to fetch local weather to help assess migraine risk. Location is sent to a third-party weather provider to return forecasts.
- **On-device records (migraine, sleep, RLS, settings):** Stored locally. We do not receive or store this data on our servers.

**How We Use Data**
- Provide core functionality (local weather + risk factors).
- We do **not** use data for advertising or cross-app tracking.

**Sharing**
- We share **precise location** with our weather provider solely to request forecasts. No other personal data is shared. We do not sell your data.

**Your Choices**
- **Location:** Revoke “Location While Using the App” in iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services.
- **Profile/Data Reset:** You can delete/reset your in-app profile at any time.
- **Export/Sharing:** Any export/sharing is initiated by you.

**Data Retention**
- Records remain on your device until you delete the app or reset data. We do not maintain cloud copies.

**Security**
- Data remains on your device under iOS protections. Use a device passcode/biometrics.
